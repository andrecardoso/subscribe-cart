# Simple Shopping Cart Exercise

## Overview

The code was written in JavaScript using babel to leverage modern language features.

There is a very simple html UI where you can input the cart text description, click on the "Calculate" button and see the result below it.

## How to run it locally

Make sure to have node installed (I used the latest stable version, but versions higher than 10 should work), then follow these steps:

1. `npm install`
1. `npm start`
1. Open `http://localhost:8080` on a modern browser

## Running the unit tests

1. `npm test`
